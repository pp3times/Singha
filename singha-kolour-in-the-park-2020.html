                        Festival filled with smiles and precious memories.

                        <br><br>
                        This year again, we were determined to offer an unforgettable music festival experience through
                        top notch music, delicious food, and a variety of fun activities.<br><br>
                        <img src="https://www.singha.com/uploads/articles/2020%20Kolour/03.jpg" class="w-100 mb-4"><br>
                        Kolour in the Park’s 6th edition, now a one-day-only yearly rendez-vous for music lovers and
                        fun-loving Bangkokians, was a success from start to finish.
                        <br><br>
                        The event took place at Thai Wake Park with 3 music stages, offering festivalgoers a chance to
                        witness world class DJs, bands, and artists. <br><br>
                        The “Park Stage” focused on live performances and was a must-go destination to see local and
                        international cutting-edge bands. House and Techno lovers were drawn to the “Shelter Stage”
                        where all day and night DJ performances took place. For those who prefer grooving to disco and
                        funk, the “Water Stage” was undoubtedly the place to be. <br>
                        <br><img src="https://www.singha.com/uploads/articles/2020%20Kolour/04.jpg"
                            class="w-100 mb-4"><br>
                        Kolour in the Park’s line-up featured both local and international artists, new and confirmed
                        including ARTBAT, a Beatport top-charting House & Techno producer; Black Coffee, South Africa
                        legendary House music DJ and producer; and Oddisee, a creative rapper from the USA. <br>

                        Besides awesome music performances, Kolour in the Park 2020 encouraged attendees to express
                        their sense of style through unique fashion pieces and let their individuality shine to the
                        fullest.
                        <br>
                        The venue was also decked with exciting activities keeping guests entertained, with the three
                        most notable being Boxing Classes, D.I.Y Somtum cooking classes, and a Silent Disco.
                        <br><br><img src="https://www.singha.com/uploads/articles/2020%20Kolour/06.jpg"
                            class="w-100 mb-4">
                        Heart rates and adrenaline levels were raised in the Boxing Class Zone, where guests were able
                        to witness live boxing matches right in front of their eyes. For those who wanted to experience
                        something truly unique to Thailand, Singha also coordinated training sessions run by the
                        renowned boxing camp of top fighter Buakaw.

                            class="w-100 mb-4">
                        Knowing what our customers craved and loved, we partnered with Made by TODD to bring you the hot
                        and spicy flavors of Thailand. At D.I.Y. Somtum, guests were invited to recreate the familiar
                        taste of the traditional papaya salad and cook a personalized menu unique to their own
                        preferences. For those in the mood to chill, skilled chefs were on hand to cook up a storm.

                            class="w-100 mb-4">
                        Specially initiated by Singha this year, the Silent Disco zone was the festival corner for a
                        low-key start to the festivities or a well-deserved break from the party atmosphere. Equipped
                        with headphones, guests could immerse themselves in the sound of world-class DJs without
                        disturbing anyone and jam to live performances in the comfort of their own space. With each
                        person kicking back to their own soundtrack while sipping on Singha beer, it was the ideal vibe
                        to recharge one’s battery. <br>
                        For those who missed out on the amazing music, fun, and delicious food, stay tuned for where
                        Singha Music will take you next.
