                        Singha Beer Food Pairing<br><br>
                        It’s normal to come across one of the most popular alcoholic drinks being paired with Thai fare,
                        especially fried appetizer nibbles. Not only does the bubbly brew complement the food by
                        refreshing the body, there are also profound science behind beer pairing with food that can take
                        the whole dining experience to the next level.

                        R-Haan Restaurant Bangkok and Chumpol Jangprai R-Haan Head Chef<br><br>
                        From the conversation with the chef Chumpol Jangprai, the head chef of R-HAAN restaurant and the
                        celebrity chef from the reality cooking show Iron Chef Thailand, beer pairing with food is not
                        common only in Thailand, but the matching has also been shared among the world’s culinary
                        cultures for centuries. As of Thai delicacies which are spicy and exquisite, beer also boasts of
                        an intense flavor profile that makes Thai food and beer a perfect fit for each other<br><br>
                        Chef Chumpol, who’s passionate about beer pairing with food as beer is one of the easiest
                        alcoholic beverages to drink, explains that flavorsome Thai meal can complement beer
                        appreciation. Likewise, beer that excels in smooth flavor like Singha can make the whole meal
                        become more appetizing and well-rounded.

                        Chumpol Jangprai Celebrity Chef Iron Chef Thailand<br><br>

                        “The sharing flavor of beer and Thai food is the intensity and slight bitterness, especially in
                        Thai
                        curries. Therefore, they can easily complement each other when enjoying together. It’s common to
                        drink beer and instantly crave spicy food. Also, when we drink beer along with a spicy meal, it
                        can
                        make us enjoy the whole dining experience even more.”<br><br>

                        Today, the top chef of Thai cuisine will give all the answers why spicy Thai foods and beer are
                        the
                        perfect combinations and have been constantly paired together on the table through four of his
                        tantalizing creations.<br><br>

                        These four meticulously-created items are selected by chef Chumpol for their outstanding
                        features
                        which make them impeccable with the malted brew.

                        Laarb Tord Kahi Sawan Northeastern Thai Dish<br><br>

                        Starting off with the first item, <strong>Laarb Tord Khai Sawan </strong>, the amuse-bouche that
                        incorporates
                        grounded free-range Kurobuta pork. The succulent meat is tossed with spicy-heavy Laarb
                        condiments and brought to another level by ant roe from Khao Yai. The tasty combination is then
                        mixed with Khao Mao (fried ear of rice) for extra crispiness. According to the chef, this dish
                        is the perfect representative of Northeastern flavor as it brings spiciness, acidity and
                        sweetness to the table. That’s why it’s the perfect condiment to a nice chilled glass of Singha
                        beer.

                    <div class="fs-5 mb-5">
                        Pla Naem Sausage and Singha Beer<br><br>

                        Garb He Chom Krueng Khao Wan, the noted Thai poem that celebrates tantalizing dishes of royal
                        haute cuisine, mentions the enticing flavor of Moo Naem (spice-mixed pork) which affiliates to
                        chef <strong>Chumpol’s Royal-style Pla Naem Sausage</strong>, the drool-worthy dish that excels
                        in sourness from fermentation. The selection blends harmoniously elements of Thai cooking
                        techniques like grilling and marinating which best showcase the flavor of each ingredient. Pla
                        Naem Sausage is the testament that beer is not only a perfect match for only fried items and
                        curry. The slight acidity and sweetness from toasted rice can magically cut through the
                        intensity of lager beer.

                    <div class="fs-5 mb-5">
                        Charcoal-grilled Korat Chicken<br><br>

                        The next selected item is <strong>Korat Chicken</strong>. This item is chosen by chef Chumpol
                        thanks to the inseparable relationship between grilled goodies and beer. This particular dish is
                        outstanding for the firm texture, the aromatic note from marinating and the soothing smell of
                        the rosemary that perfectly combine with beer. Chef Chumpol explains further that Singha beer
                        that boasts medium bitterness (the lager is the product from the second layer during
                        sedimentation with an injection of ale that cuts through the sweetness of barley) can
                        undoubtedly go together with this dish that features the sweet sauce and soothing rosemary
                        aroma.

                    </div>

                    <div class="fs-5 mb-5">
                        Thai-style Massaman Chicken<br><br>

                        Last but not least, the <strong>Massaman Chicken</strong> is recommended by chef Chumpol above all other
                        dishes thanks to the distinguishing flavor of herb injected in the curry paste, producing the
                        intensity with slight bitter finish. Therefore, it becomes the perfect match to Singha beer.

                        “Massaman Chicken Curry is fiery and boasts of a distinct aroma from the curry paste. While
                        enjoying with beer, the brew will bring out the flavor of the curry even more” explained Chef
                        Chumpol.

                        For those who would love to experience an authentic Thai cuisine along with mellow-yet-intense
                        Singha lager, a visit to R-HAAN restaurant is highly recommended. Chef Chumpol will conjure up
                        these four amazing selections along with other signature dishes of the restaurant that promise a
                        relishing experience.
